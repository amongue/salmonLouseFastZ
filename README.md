Repository for custom R scripts used in the salmon louse faster Z analyses. Contains two R files:
1. SNP_curation_salmonlouse.R used to parse single nucleotide variants to (i) evaluate outgroup variants to filter out shared polymorphisms from true divergences
and (ii) to polarize polymorphic allele frequencies into ancestral vs derived for later subsetting based on allele frequency.
2. salmon_explore_RNAseq_refine_revision.R used to perform all statistical analyses and plotting in the manuscript and supplement.

The rest of the files are inputs for these scripts.
